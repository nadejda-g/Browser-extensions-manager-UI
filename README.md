## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Responsive design workflow


### What I learned

It was challenging for me to improve the interactive part of this website. All JavaScript implemented was a huge refresh of my knowleges. I've used fetching data from given data.json file to build all extensions card and their description. Also added interactive features using event listeners  and other facilities offered by js.

### Continued development

Going to improve my js skills and focus more on learning js frameworks and libraries.
